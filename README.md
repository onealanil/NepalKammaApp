# NepalKamma (In Development 🚧)

**NepalKamma** is a React Native (CLI-based) Android application built to combat the rising unemployment problem in Nepal. It connects job seekers with short-term or gig-based employment opportunities such as painting, plumbing, electrical work, and other hands-on services—facilitating local, offline freelancing-style work.

> 📱 *Think of it as a localized gig platform, tailored for Nepal's workforce needs.*
